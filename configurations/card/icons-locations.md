# Icons locations

If you want to specify where to draw the icons of your card you have to use this special property:

```yaml
  icons:
    icon_1:
      x: 20
      y: 20
    icon_2:
      x: 20
      y: 40
    icon_3:
      x: 20
      y: 60
    icon_4:
      x: 20
      y: 80
    icon_5:
      x: 20
      y: 100
```

This example setting tells the plugin to draw the icons on these coords on the card.  
The card coords are shown in this screenshot:
